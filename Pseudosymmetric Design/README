INTRODUCTION
This script is for modeling the impact of single and pairwise point mutations on the energetics of trimeric protein complexes with C3 symmetry

METHOD
Step 1: Scaffold prep using rosetta_relax

Step 2: Distance calculations.

Once the scaffolds are appropriately prepared, the next step is to calculate distances between residues in the interface. Create a tasks list for rosetta design for all residues that have a contact distance less than 8 Angstroms.

Step 3: Enumerate mutations

Create a task list with the following structure

bash enumerative_interface.sh resi1 resn1 resi2 resn2

eg.
bash enumerative_interface.sh 118 Y 91 I

Step 4: Run enumerative design

bash tasks
